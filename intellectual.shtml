		<p class="style1"><strong>Baseline</strong></p>

		<p class="style1">When I hear the word  &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;, my interest is piqued. While I can conceptually understand why  the term has some negative associations, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be an  intellectual. Not the cold-blooded stereotype who studies reality from afar.  But a compassionate intellectual, who perceives others emotions, creatively reasons  out problems and reflects on the impact of her actions. What else is the mind  for if not to be used well?</p>
		<p class="style1">My desire to share and learn  cooperatively has led me to connect with others in the library field for  lengthy discussions of issues, both face to face and through online communities.  At a library supervisors meeting, I spoke on diversity, incorporating  experiences in Deaf culture and my knowledge of American Sign Language. As a  student teacher, I took the initiative to create and present a media literacy  unit for the school&rsquo;s 6th grade classes. My goal was to help  students become critically thinking consumers of mass media.</p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>My Development</strong></p>
		<p class="style1">As the time neared for me to  take the required Research Methods course, I was full of nervous excitement.  This class mattered greatly to me. I&rsquo;d always been interested in research. Research has  the potential to change the direction of a society and improve individuals&rsquo;  quality of life. I remember getting sidetracked during my undergraduate years because  I wanted to read the research more than write the paper. But I hadn&rsquo;t had the  opportunity to be involved in a formal research process. I considered this  course to be a personal test of sorts. Would I really enjoy being a researcher or  would I rather just read someone else&rsquo;s results?</p>
		<p class="style1">I wanted the study I conducted  in class to be of use to the professional community. In the months before the  course, I began to ponder librarian&rsquo;s responses to certain genres of fiction. It  occurred to me that some of the highest selling and circulating genres such  as romance and some mysteries were generally disdained when librarians talked  amongst themselves. I wanted to know if the personal taste of a librarian would  have an impact on the reader&rsquo;s advisory services they provided to patrons. As  soon as the quarter began, I let my classmates know about my research  interests. Fortunately, three other students were willing to sign on: Stephanie  Hall, Emily Inlow and Heather Tucker. Our instructor, Dr. Hazel Taylor, helped  us focus on what progress we could make on our research question in a single academic  quarter.</p>
		<p class="style1">We decided to conduct a  pilot study by surveying librarians and library staff about their personal  reading preferences as well as some questions about their reader&rsquo;s advisory  work. When I mentioned the project on an email discussion group of librarians I  participate in, I received several inquiries and requests for the results. I  knew to publish the results, I would need approval from Human Subjects  Division, but I was also aware it was a lengthy process rarely attempted for  student course projects. My group felt it important to be able to share our  results and we worked to make our project pieces ready in time. With help from  Dr. Taylor and Dr. Alpha DeLap, iSchool Director of Research Services, I gathered the requisite information and we received  approval prior to launching our survey.</p>
		<p class="style1">We had much interest and  support from the professional community for our survey. In the end, we received  225 responses which was a bit overwhelming to analyze in our course time frame.  We were able to analyze and write about the quantitative results and report on  a subset of the qualitative data. The result was an interesting paper, but one  that I&rsquo;m eager to revise. For most of our group it was our first attempt at  writing a research paper and Dr. Taylor gave us much useful feedback we have yet to  incorporate. My classmates have agreed to remain in touch and help me rewrite  the paper after I have conducted analysis on the entire set of qualitative data. In particular, I will be looking for patterns between the repondents personal preferences, the level of training in reader's advisory and the self-reported steps taken when performing reader's advisory services. When the process is complete, we want to submit the paper for publication to a journal such as<a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/rusa/rusapubs/rusq/referenceuser.htm" target="_blank"><em> Reference and User Services Quarterly</em></a>. We have also considered submitting a summary article of our findings to a practitioner’s publication like <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/pla/plapubs/publiclibraries/publiclibraries.htm" target="_blank"><em>Public Libraries</em></a>. After that, I am  interested  in working with another researcher to follow up this study with focus groups  and field observations to compare what is reported by librarians and what happens in practice. After this research project, I feel confident that I can  conduct research and enjoy it.</p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>Additional Experiences</strong></p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li class="style1">For Dr. Matt Saxton, I completed &ldquo;Secret Patron&rdquo;       surveys for the Seattle Public Library Reference Services Model       Evaluation. Also under his direction, I conducted interviews of SPL       Central staff for &ldquo;Library as Place&rdquo; research.</li>
		  <li class="style1">Over the last two years I&rsquo;ve written several       booklists as a member of the <a href="http://www.sno-isle.org" target="_blank">Sno-Isle Libraries</a> Reader&rsquo;s Advisory Team.</li>
		  <li class="style1">I have written reviews of teen literature for       the <a href="http://www.kcls.org/evergreen/about_washyarg.cfm" target="_blank">Washington State Young Adult Review Group</a> (WASHYARG), a regional       reviewing organization of school and public librarians and other       individuals interested in books, magazines, films, cassettes, videos, and       other materials appropriate for adolescent use and intent.</li>
		  <li class="style1">I contributed articles for the iSchool student       publication <em><a href="http://students.washington.edu/aliss/silverfish/" target="_blank">The Silverfish</a>.</em></li>

		<tr>
		<td class="bodyText"><p class="style1">Looking far back into my  life, it seems clear that I decided to climb this particular mountain at an  early age. I fell in love with learning as soon as I understood the concept and  had determined to achieve the highest educational level the world could offer.  Of course, as they say, life happens. Although my immediate focus changed at  times, it is now evident that my underlying plan, the desire of my heart, was  never altered. Despite myself, I have made it to the pinnacle labeled &ldquo;master&rsquo;s  degree&rdquo;. From my new vantage point, I ask myself what has changed. Is it simply  that I&rsquo;m higher up in the world? Or has the journey up the mountain transformed  me somehow?</p>
		  <p class="style1">The moment I was accepted to  the MLIS program, I began to, and continue to, make the most of my opportunities.  Throughout this portfolio I have demonstrated how these opportunities have  shaped me intellectually and professionally. The overarching lessons I learned  from my experiences fall into three categories: the power of passion, the power  of self-knowledge and the power of endurance.</p>
		  <p class="style1"><strong>The Power of Passion</strong></p>
		  <p class="style1">It was certainly my passions  that brought me here: a passion for information, a passion for librarianship  and a passion for knowledge. As I entered the program and discussed my passions  with others, I found common ground upon which to build relationships. These  relationships led to my most successful projects such as the iPeer program, reader&rsquo;s  advisory research and reorganizing a school library. I also realized that my  passion for a subject is reflected in a higher quality for final product as  exemplified by the training I conducted and the website I built. My experiences  in the program have taught me the value of giving voice to my passions and  collaborating with others to create meaningful work.</p>
		  <p class="style1"><strong>The Power of Self-Knowledge</strong></p>
		  <p class="style1">I love the oft quoted line  from <em>Hamlet, </em>&ldquo;This above all: to  thine own self be true&rdquo;. Yet I feel the verity of this statement comes in the  conclusion of the thought, &ldquo;And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou  cans't not be false to any man.&rdquo; The more knowledge I have of my own  intentions, habits and abilities, the more I can leverage that knowledge as I  make commitments to other people and organizations. Through this program, I  have gained a clearer picture of what I can accomplish, the personal strengths  I can utilize and what work offers me the most satisfaction. Through trial and  error I also discovered my personal limit on the number of projects and  concerns I can maintain at a time. All this self-knowledge has made me a better  employee, a better team member and a happier person overall. </p>
		  <p class="style1"><strong>The Power of Endurance</strong></p>
		  <p class="style1">I occasionally ask myself  why I can&rsquo;t just sit still. But there&rsquo;s so much I desire to accomplish and I  know I have the ability to do so. These big dreams require big efforts. While  in this program I came to appreciate how great achievements are built from  consistent, sustained hard work. Whether a class assignment, a volunteer  project or earning a master&rsquo;s degree, I performed each step required to bring  about success in the long term. When my progress stalled or seemed  overwhelming, I drew upon resources both inside myself and within those around  me. Discovering my capability to see a major achievement through to the end was  one of the greatest rewards of this program.</p>
		  <p class="style1">This journey has indeed been  transformative. As I move on to climb other mountains, I am wiser and better  prepared to reach the top.</p>

		<p><strong>Baseline</strong></p>

		<p>I still remember all the  kids in my elementary school being shuffled into an unused classroom, grade by  grade, to see the personal computers donated by Apple. The green screen and  blinking cursor offered a new world to be explored. Always interested in trying  something new, I found personal computing fun and useful at an early age. </p>
		<p>One of my most memorable  school assignments was a multimedia presentation I developed on the history of  radio utilizing computer technology available at the time. During my  undergraduate years I quickly grasped the power of email to connect with  friends and share information. The rise of the Web suited my drive for  information and connections. In the workplace, I embraced software tools that  allowed me to instruct and inform in entertaining ways, such as developing  PowerPoint presentations on library databases aimed at middle school students.</p>
		<p><strong>My Development</strong></p>
		<p>My first quarter in the  program, students studying primarily via online tools were asked to take the  course Internet Technologies and Applications. I knew I was a reasonably savvy  Internet user and found most end-user applications intuitive to use for my  purposes. Yet I was also aware how shallow my understanding was compared to the  potential of what I could know about this technology I depend upon. This course  taught me about the hardware and technologies that create my daily Internet  experience. Having this knowledge added to my confidence in computing because I  had more understanding of the processes behind it. I always prefer to know  what&rsquo;s happening behind the curtain when possible.</p>
		<p>For me the heart of this  class was learning basic skills in website creation and development. While my  classmates commented that this was a &ldquo;neat&rdquo; or &ldquo;useful&rdquo; exercise, it was  significantly more than that for me. By learning some simple codes, I had  gained the power to create and share with the world instantaneously. The  experience echoed the thrill of first realizing I could use pen and paper to  communicate with others. It was a monumental shift from being a passive Web  user to being an active Web builder. Immediately I set up a <a href="http://students.washington.edu/sarahe" target="_blank">student homepage</a> to  share information with my friends and family about my school program.</p>
		<p>We were encouraged to design  our website final project around something we were interested in. I didn&rsquo;t want  my site to simply reflect a hobby of mine. I decided it should be something I&rsquo;d  want to come back to and build into a potentially useful site for others. I was  inspired by one of my favorite sites, <a href="http://www.noflyingnotights.com/" target="_blank">No Flying, No Tights</a>, started by a  library worker to share her reviews of graphic novels. Therefore I created <a href="http://students.washington.edu/sarahe/sounds_great" target="_blank">Sounds  Great</a> as a place to begin sharing my experiences with audio books, an  increasingly popular entertainment source. On my site I laid out eight basic  categories representing the genres I tend to listen to and wrote an initial  review for each one. I received positive feedback from my classmates and the  librarians to whom I showed my new site. I was particularly pleased that I had  &ldquo;hand coded&rdquo; the site in HTML and used a CSS for the layout instead of relying  on editing software. I knew in the future I&rsquo;d occasionally need the assistance  of software to create a more complicated site (such as this one). But the  experience had given me a sense of my own potential and inspired me for future  projects.</p>
		<p><strong>Additional Experiences</strong></p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li>I created a basic website for the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/aliss/ipeer/" target="_blank">iPeer program</a> that       I co-created and administrated for one year. The site included an intake       form for program participants.</li>
		  <li>To support the reader&rsquo;s advisory training I was       planning, I created a <a href="http://inspiredlibrarian.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blog</a> on the topic. It became a place to gather links       and information relevant to the training and its subject matter.</li>
		  <li>To further my knowledge of useful web design I       took a 3 credit seminar in Information Architecture offered through the       <a href="http://www.ischool.washington.edu/msim/default.aspx" target="_blank">Masters of Science in Information Management Program</a>.</li>
		  <li>Last year I was appointed a member of the Web  Advisory Team for my employer's new website. In this capacity, I&rsquo;ve had the fascinating  opportunity to assist in usability testing of the site, discuss user  behavior and consider better designs for user needs. I&rsquo;ve also been responsible for the proofing various pages on our site.</li>

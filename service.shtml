		<p class="style1"><strong>Baseline</strong></p>

		<p class="style1">Give back. As much as you  have received help and support from others, give back for the greater good of  the community. This is what my family taught me and it was made clear the more  success I experienced, the greater my responsibility to help others succeed.  Therefore in every position I find myself in, I use the skills and  opportunities at my disposal to make things better.</p>
		<p class="style1">The very nature of library work  is to be of service connecting users with the information they need. Working in  public libraries I not only learned some of the practical arts of librarianship  but began to apply them to assist others. When a new subgenre of teen  literature gained popularity, I volunteered to create a bibliography on the  topic for library staff to utilize with patrons. During my elementary education  studies, classmates and instructors relied on me for book recommendations and  information about publishing trends. I was happy to oblige and loved being of  service.</p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>My Development</strong></p>
		<p class="style1">One of the things my husband  and I love most about our children&rsquo;s school is an emphasis on family  involvement. In our gratitude for the well-rounded education our kids receive,  we make an effort to support the school in the ways that we can. So when the  school director approached me and asked if I&rsquo;d take on a project involving  their book collection, I gladly accepted. When she realized I  was both working and going to school, she tried to take back the request, but I  pointed out that this was a perfect opportunity to apply the skills I was  learning in my masters program.</p>
		<p class="style1"><a href="http://www.sprucestreetschool.org" target="_blank">Spruce Street School</a> is a Pre-K through 5th grade school  of 82 students located in downtown Seattle.  As a small school, they don&rsquo;t have a librarian and had not had a formal library  area. But they certainly have books. Over the years, hundreds of books had been  purchased, donated or left to the school. Each teacher keeps a core collection  in their classroom but the rest were stored in loose order in an unused room.  The plan was to use the summer break period for moving the books into a room that would become the  library and breakout study area.</p>
		<p class="style1">My first priority was to  find out what the school needed from the collection. I created and administered  a survey to the teachers and staff to ascertain how the collection was being  used. Based on that information, I established a policy for retention and began  going through the books. This was an informative experience for me because I  had to change my habitual way of thinking. The large public library system that  I work for emphasizes maintaining a clean, up-to-date and attractive collection  for all ages. The focus is entertainment and lifelong learning. At the school,  I was retaining books to support the curricular and pleasure reading needs of 4  through 11 year olds while remembering that the budget for replacement books  would be much smaller.</p>
		<p class="style1">Because no educator ever  wants to throw out a book, there were many items that were irrelevant or  unusable. I filled up over 20 boxes of books which the school donated to local  shelters. I made a list of subject areas that needed more titles and reported  to the school staff and faculty. By the time school  started, the usable books were on the shelves of the newly dubbed library. The  unexpected benefit was the positive response of parents and students. At the  first day of school festivities, several parents told me how happy they were to  finally have a &ldquo;real&rdquo; library in the school. But the best response was when my  seven year old told his class during a school tour, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the library my mommy  made!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="style1"><strong>Additional Experiences</strong></p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li class="style1">For over two years I have served as a member of       <a href="http://www.sno-isle.org" target="_blank">Sno-Isle Libraries</a>&rsquo; Reader&rsquo;s Advisory Team. This team creates booklists       and content for the library website and advises on training for public       services staff.</li>
		  <li class="style1">Last year I was asked to coordinate a women&rsquo;s       book club for my church. For each month&rsquo;s selection I gather background       information and questions to share with the group and moderate the       discussion.</li>
		  <li class="style1">For a school fundraiser, I donated my services       as moderator for two book discussion parties and brought appetizers       related to the stories for a complete book experience.</li>

		<p><strong>Baseline</strong></p>

		<p>In my life, leadership is a  bit like breathing. It just happens whether I intend it to or not. Many times  this led to being in charge, but I quickly figured out that management and  leadership are different things. My aim is to be a positive influence on those  around me. I reflected on what makes me a leader and identified these  characteristics:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>I&rsquo;m naturally  curious and interested in other people.</li>
		  <li>I&rsquo;m willing to  try new things and have lots of energy to see them through.</li>
		  <li>I&rsquo;m not afraid  to question and speak out when this is appropriate.</li>
		  <li>I strive to  maintain a healthy, global perspective on issues.</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>While I find myself leading  in many aspects of my life, my most memorable accomplishments before this  program were achieved through my position as library manager. I established  educational programs for teens and adults in my branch. I reestablished  connections with the local school librarians. Most significantly, I reformed  the Friends of the Brier Library into an active fundraising group.</p>
		<p><strong>My Development</strong></p>
		<p>When I applied to the MLIS program, I choose to apply to the “distance” version despite living nearby. Having a family and working full-time, I needed the flexibility of online asynchronous education. Yet I didn’t want to give up the learning that occurs during interactions with classmates and instructors. Fortunately this program has quarterly face to face residencies and offers technologies for online community building. I jumped in and made the personal connections I needed to see me through. I believe that graduate education is much more than what happens within the confines of required coursework. Therefore I made a point to fit into my schedule iSchool projects where I could both learn and utilize my skills.</p>
		<p>		  At an open meeting during my second quarter, a first year student voiced a  desire to know which students in the program lived near her. I understood the  desire and had already made an effort to find other Seattleites I could call or  meet in person. It was pointed out that due to privacy laws the school couldn&rsquo;t  share that information but if a student wanted to build such a list, it would  be a great portfolio project. Having a strong desire to help others make the  connections I had forged for myself, I expressed my interest in the project. I  was soon put into contact with Linda Nixon  from Oregon,  a student one year ahead of me in the program.</p>
		<p>		  I knew right away this would stretch my leadership skills. While I&rsquo;d held  many leadership roles in my life, it was always within an established  organization. Now I was not only responsible for building a structure from the  bottom up, but I had to collaborate with a person living in a different state.  Fortunately Linda and I established an easy online relationship and remained in  regular communication throughout the process. My commitment to participating in the  iSchool had afforded me knowledge of who to contact for input and support on  such a project. I became &ldquo;the front person&rdquo; who presented iPeer to the community  at large, wrote materials and coordinated details with student services and  campus leaders. Linda became &ldquo;the back person&rdquo; who matched peers, monitored  issues and worked with program participants. Because we kept each other well informed  our roles were interchangeable when need be and we shared the workload.  Entering the program in different years, we each had a unique set of contacts  and experiences that added strength to our leadership. As we began working on  the details of our program, I was nominated and elected Distance Representative  for the <a href="http://students.washington.edu/aliss" target="_blank">Association of Library and Information School Students</a>. This helped us  establish our newly named &ldquo;iPeer&rdquo; program under the arm of ALISS, giving us web  space and funds as needed.</p>
		<p>		  We quickly realized it wasn&rsquo;t the continuing students who were looking for  connections but the incoming students who needed a lifeline as they started  out. By spring, we had established a web based questionnaire and I delivered  flyers to be included in the mailing for new distance students. Linda began  matching new and experienced students based on self-reported qualities such as  location and career interests. As ALISS Representative, I began sending regular  emails to the distance students reminding them of the many opportunities they  have to get connected, including iPeer. By fall, we had 25% of the new students  matched up with experienced ones. In a follow up survey, many students reported  positive experiences with iPeer and expressed gratitude for the program. We  also received feedback that overall this new cohort felt connected and warmly  welcomed. Linda and I were determined that this tradition would continue. By  the following winter we had created a guiding document with information on how  to run the program and found three new administrators to replace ourselves.  This fall it was rewarding to see the program continue with 50% of the incoming  distance students participating. More important to me than knowing I can set up  a program is to know that I established something with lasting value.</p>
		<p><strong>Additional Experiences</strong></p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li>For two years I have served as co-moderator of       the iYouth listserv for the discussion of children&rsquo;s and teen library       services.</li>
		  <li>As ALISS distance representative I administered       two surveys on elective preferences, gave survival tips at the new dMLIS       orientation and sent regular email announcements relevant to distance       student life.</li>
		  <li>My active participation in   iSchool life resulted in increased visibility for myself and distance students  in general. In 2006 I became the first distance program student to be elected  President of ALISS. In this capacity I have appointed graduate student  senators, established an online forum for student textbook sales and hosted a  brown bag discussion for students with the Beverly Cleary Professor in  Children&rsquo;s and Youth Services.</li>

		<ul type="disc">
          <li class="style3">my husband Andre. Thank you for not only keeping       me fed and in clean clothes, but for trusting me that this was the right       path to put our family on. And for that wonderful knack you have for       making me laugh. Here&rsquo;s to a future with more time together.</li>
		  <li class="style3">my sons Noah and Thomas. Thank you for trying to       understand why Momma was always so busy. I love many things in this world       but you two are my greatest treasure. Being with each of you is the best       part of my day.</li>
		  <li class="style3">my mom and dad for being my biggest fans from day       one and continuing to support me in the choices I make. Special thanks to       mom for not fussing over my &ldquo;burning the candle at both ends&rdquo; too often. Just       often enough to let me know I&rsquo;m loved.</li>
		  <li class="style3">my supervisor, Judy, for cheering me on, having       great patience with the effects of my stress level and being such a wise       mentor and friend.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Sno-Isle librarians Evie, Michael, Nancy M.,       Terry, Kathleen F., Erica and Lesly for your mentorship, support and       affection.</li>
		  <li class="style3">my staff, past and present, at the Brier       Library. Thank you for understanding when my brain was in three different       places and keeping the branch running smoothly. You make me       look great!</li>
		  <li class="style3">the super cool gang at SPL Central fiction       department, Misha, Hannah, Linda, Jen and especially David for your kind       words and faith in my abilities.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Mike Eisenberg for speaking at the WLA       Conference of 2001. I don&rsquo;t remember what you talked about, but I knew       from that moment on I couldn&rsquo;t stand not to be a professional librarian.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Joe Janes for unknowingly influencing my choice       of schools by your charming words at the info session I attended. And for       knowingly influencing me at the times I&rsquo;ve needed direction.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Harry Bruce for being a warm and honest advisor       and an example of excellence worth striving for.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Marie Potter and Nancy Gershenfeld for helping       me feel at home in the iSchool and reassuring me when I wasn&rsquo;t feeling my       most confident. And just for being good company.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Sarah L., Gregory T., Robert F. and Linda N. for       being my &ldquo;sanity check&rdquo; crew and sharing frustrations and joys. Every grad       student needs friends like you guys.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Scott Barker for patiently       shepherding our entire cohort through the insanity that is the first       quarter of distance education. We couldn&rsquo;t shower you with enough virtual       baked goods to show our appreciation and affection.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Emily, Heather and Stephanie for embarking on a       class project so huge in scope. Also thanks to Hazel Taylor and Matt       Saxton for warmly advising and encouraging us.</li>
		  <li class="style3">the ALISS Officers of 2006-2007. Each of you is       amazingly talented and I&rsquo;m delighted that I&rsquo;ve had the chance to work with       you. I&rsquo;ll be your reference any day.</li>
		  <li class="style3">Grace Whiteaker for being an awesome advocate for distance education done right.</li>
		  <li class="style3">each of my instructors, particularly those who       were patient with me when real life spilled over into my academic life.       Working and having a family while going to school is a tough gig. But       through your support and understanding I made it through.</li>
